# Plant-Diseases-Detection-CNN
A CNN Model To Detect Plant Diseases

### For Developing a Plant Diseases Detection, i use:
* Convolutional Neural Network: is a class of deep neural networks, most applied to analysing visual imagery. its widely used in applications of image and video recognition.
### To Build CNN I will use some popularly used open-source libraries:
* Keras : a high-level API to build and train deep learning models Runs on top of TensorFlow models. Because to preform computations and math operations.
* Tensorflow : is the most used open-source library to develop models in deep learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training of deep neural networks.
## Dataset 
For The plant disease detection, we used a publicly available and famous Dataset “Plant Village Dataset.”
This Dataset Contains 54,305 images of plant leaves collected under different environment Conditions, Pictures of plants Leaves are divided into the following:
Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato.
*I CHOOSE TO USE ONLY POTATO AND TOMATO DISEASES*
